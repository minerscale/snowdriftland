	<text name="body"><![CDATA[The Wario Ware team took an idea so wacky, it could only be made with the latest technology... the Wii Remote. With about 200 lightning-quick microgames and controls that range from scribbling to flailing, WarioWare: Smooth Moves takes interactive gaming to a whole new level. All players need is a Wii Remote and their best moves to be the champ. With games that are as much fun to play as they are to WATCH people play, WarioWare: Smooth Moves brings the party to its feet. Itâ€™s hilarious for players and audiences alike.]]></text>
